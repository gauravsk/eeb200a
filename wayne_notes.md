### Intro to evolution  
The concept of evolution has changed since Darwin- matured into thinking about genotypic changes across time.  
A variety of sources of evidence have been used to develop the theories of evolution. The fact of evolution- that there was descent with modification- long predates Darwin. 

Four premises led Darwin to his theory of evolution-   
1. More individuals are born than can possibly survive;   
2. There will be a struggle for existence;     
3. There is some phenotypic variation among the individuals;  
4. So, the phenotypes that are better at reproducing will grow in proportion (i.e. evolution happens).  

At the time of Darwin, thinking was very typological- platonic ideals of species, with mistakes, not variation. Much of OOS is focused on anagenisis, rather than speciation per se.  

At the time of Darwin, there were a few key problems of 
1) No mechanism of inheritance;  
2) Gaps in geological records;  
3) Origin of complex structures.   

Post-Darwinian advances have included Mendel's work on particulate inheritence; Fischer, Mayr etc's pushing of theory forward; Motoo Kimura's neutral theory; modern discovery of abundant genetic variation.  

**Persistent problems**  
1. Evolution of sexual reproduction (two-fold cost);  
2. Imporatance of selection vs natural processes (selection leaves signal across genome, and many genes now seem to be under selection);  
3. Development (Evo-Devo)- how does substantial phenotypic change come about;  
4. Speciation;  
5. Unit of selection.
