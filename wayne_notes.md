### Intro to evolution  
The concept of evolution has changed since Darwin- matured into thinking about genotypic changes across time.  
A variety of sources of evidence have been used to develop the theories of evolution. The fact of evolution- that there was descent with modification- long predates Darwin. 

Four premises led Darwin to his theory of evolution-   
1. More individuals are born than can possibly survive;   
2. There will be a struggle for existence;     
3. There is some phenotypic variation among the individuals;  
4. So, the phenotypes that are better at reproducing will grow in proportion (i.e. evolution happens).  

At the time of Darwin, thinking was very typological- platonic ideals of species, with mistakes, not variation. Much of OOS is focused on anagenisis, rather than speciation per se.  

At the time of Darwin, there were a few key problems of 
1) No mechanism of inheritance;  
2) Gaps in geological records;  
3) Origin of complex structures.   

Post-Darwinian advances have included Mendel's work on particulate inheritence; Fischer, Mayr etc's pushing of theory forward; Motoo Kimura's neutral theory; modern discovery of abundant genetic variation.  

**Persistent problems**  
1. Evolution of sexual reproduction (two-fold cost);  
2. Imporatance of selection vs natural processes (selection leaves signal across genome, and many genes now seem to be under selection);  
3. Development (Evo-Devo)- how does substantial phenotypic change come about;  
4. Speciation;  
5. Unit of selection.  

**Darwin's lines of evidence**  
1. Direct observation;  
2. Comparitive anatomy;  
3. Embryology/development;  
4. Biogeography;  
5. Fossil record;
6. Taxonomy.  

*Direct observation*  
- Peppered moths- a good example of a well studied system. Observational, naturally replicated experiments, replicated over time, etc.  
- Pesticide resistance/DDT.  

*Comparitive anatomy/Embryology and development*  
- Artificial selection in rock pigeons and dogs.  
- Phenotypic diversity in dogs may be generated by shifts in where allometric development is truncated (juvenilization/neoteny). Use of genomics in understanding canid evolution- cool story here.  
    Highest mtDNA diversity in East Asia- suggests the most ancient origin there. Domestication happened before agriculture - unique to dogs. Functional grouping in dogs has genetic basis, except "toy dogs" (vonHoldt 2010). This makes sense, no? Not sure why Wayne & co. did not expect this result. Genome-wide studies reveal information about bottlenecks, dating of origins, etc. Ancient DNA work has been done in dogs- kind of cool that we can see where modern dogs fall out relative to the ancient DNA (derived from skeletons). Wolves that are directly ancestral to modern dogs are probably not present today.  

*Biogeography*  
Continents tend to have organisms with similarities that likely arose through descent with modification. (Divergence)    
Continents also tend to have similar functional groups but with different body plans (eg herbivores). (Convergence)  
New/old world vultures are convergent- stork- and hawk-like ancestry, respectively.  
Island radiations were another key example of descent with modification- tenrecs & lemurs on Madagascar, finches on Galapagos and island honeycreepers in Hawaii are three classic examples.   
Clines- a third type of biogeographic evidence (change in phenotype with geography)  
Ring species later became a key model system.  

*Fossil record*  
- Fossils share phenotypes due to DWM;  
- There are differences between modern species and fossils- more DWM;  
- Transitional fossils show that things have changed according to environment;  
- Extinction necessitates a mechanism for generation of more diversity.

**The history of life is "bushy"**   
**Evolution represents diversification, not orthogenesis**. Distributions tend to become larger, variance changes with mean. 

*Embryology and Development*  
Darwin used this quite seriously. For a while, evolutionary biologists were all about recapitulation- embryos go through all previous life forms.  

*Taxonomy*  
Shared characteristics between organisms can only be explaiend by DWM.  

*Comparitive anatomy*  
Work by Cuvier showed that some structures were homologous- derived from shared ancestry; others, like bird and bat wings, were analogous (despite the individual structures, like the separate bones, being homologous).  
Vestigial structures are another example of why comparitive anatomy provided useful evidence about evolution. Some horses end up developing an extra toe because of incomplete gene suppression.  
Selection is constrained by contingency.
