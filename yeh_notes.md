**Suppressive interactions in drugs and antibiotics**      
Determine drug combinations requires knowing how drugs will interact- synergistically, additively, antagonistically   
The distribution is mostly even between the three- but some extreme cases are whacky! EG suppression of an effective drug in a cocktail.  "physiological antidote"- not just a chemical interaction   

using suppression to create a fitness landcape that "selects" for sensitive bacteria   
When there is a synergistic combination selection leads to resistance to both drugs. But if its a n antagonistic effect, bacteria can be "trapped" in a location susceptible to both.... but bacteria are doing well still in the body.....   

When we introduce variation in the amount of drug used, some interesting dynamics arise: there are drug combinations where getting resistance leads to decreased fitness. This is assuming that resistence comes about by rescaling their growth isoclines- this sort of makes sense because a lot of resistence comes about due to pumping out the drug. 

Resistance mutations more beneficial in synergistic drug combination than in antagonistic.  => Rate of adaptation ought to be higher in synergistic drug environment.  

Mechanism of suppresion- eg DNA/protein synthesis suppression drugs are often suppressive. This might be becuase the ratio of DNA to protein is off, and if the ratio is brought back to normal then it the host cell is happy again (mas o menos)
