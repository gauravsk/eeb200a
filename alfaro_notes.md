## Mike Alfaro

Patterns of biodiversity at or above the species level: biodiversity is unevenly distributed   
  (classic eg of Tuatara/Lizards+Snakes)- 230 MY of evolution separate the tuatara from extant lizard+snakes
  multiple processes can lead to this pattern- how can we try to tease apart which of them is true?   

We can calculate average rate of sppn in different lineages, and then do some sort of null model analysis to test whether specific clades are "exceptionally diverse." Mike's lab has done this- that particular study was done with data from 300 spp out of the many thousand, but the patterns hold true across vertebrates.    

GoLife- resolve phylogenetic history of life and integrate with trait data- correlates or causes of diversity within trait groups can be investigated. 
This succeeded AVATOL. 

Incomplete phylogenies can still be helpful- eg how many times did a trait evolve (e.g. is coral reef association conserved or did it arise multiple times?)  

Bat diversification work by Rabosky- one lineage of bats (tent-building) is a younger clade than the rest of the bats and has a much higher rate of speciation (for now) than the average rate for the groups. 

Diversity vs Disparity- the latter refers to phenotypic dissimilarity. Clades can be very species rich but functionally uniform, etc. Low sp richness and high disparity can happen if there is a lot of varaition (e.g. in body size in some fishes)   

Losos and Mahler's 2010 paper has a bivariate normal distribution along axes of diversity and disparity- do we really expect this to be normally distributed????? We know that richness often endsup being very unevenly spread. 

Alfaro & Rabosky are using BAMM to estimate speciation rate for each branch in a group of >8000 fish species- they have made histograms of speciation rate and identified certain branches which appear to have really high rates of speciation.   
We can analyse the rate of speciation or just work with rates of trait evolution.  
It is also very interesting to think about the lineages that have drastically *slow* rates of evolution.  
And it's super interesting to ask whether rates of phenotypic evolution and speciation are correlated.... appears that they are in the fishes!
Thus it appears that evolution is more likely to produce groups along a diagonal on a diversity/disparity graph, and that things in the corner seem "different"
