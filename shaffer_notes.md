## Notes on lecture by Brad Shaffer

Sustainability grand challenge-  how to adapt LA to a warmer climate?
Baseline biodiversity questions- soil microbes in LA area? Or maybe leaf microbes!  


**Conservation Science**   
Applying cutting edge *science* to achieve real solutions in species management   
**Conservation Genetics**   
Applyication of evolutionary/genetics principles for conservation problems    

There are some major trends:   
Phylogeography and species delimitation- what are the units of management?    
Phylogenetics- helps prioritize the targets of conservation    
Population and Landscape genetics    

The *genes that matter* framework is still in its infancy and the potential for fuckups is high!     

Phylogeography-- study of the process goverrning geographic distributions at each lineage (including within species)  

We can generate monophyly a long time after a population splits- eg if only one individual survives in each of two paraphyletic lineages. Sampling multiple genes from the same set of individuals  might tell us different sotries about the population's history- genes can have different histories due to recombination. 

Solid example of phylogeography --> Conservation  is the story of the salamanders with the phylogeographic split at Appalachicola River... the resulting new sp was listed as endangered, the other threateened.    

Phylogenetics and conservation - ex of Tuatara / Squamates phylogeny. All species equal <----> All clades equal.  Weighing by node counting offers something in the middle- how many nodes to get back to the bottom of the clade? Fewer nodes --> more weight.  Alternatively, Faith's PD approach suggests that branch lengths, which are proxy for "evolutionary uniqueness", are a useful alternatives.  But a drawback is that the number of ways to calculate branch length is essentially infinite- but we can argue about this.
